kill yourself is what they said to me
Im already dead, just differently
they say god is real, i disagree
cause if that were true, then we'd all be free, all be free, yeah, yeah
running from something that's killing me, dealing with such an uncomfortable feeling
beginning to feel the hostility from my ability of slowly becoming the villain
i just wanna thank all my fans especially, without you is the death of me
i dont consider myself a celebrity, but ill be doing this shit till im 70
this is my destiny, this is the best of me, its an incredible feeling to grow
letting it go, im letting you know, we're killing ourselves on the low

Cause everybody's on drugs
it's hard to believe, the american dream is a killing machine
we're all falling in love with a new disease
if it's killing you, then it's murdering me
it's all getting so unbelievable
we're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
and you don't see that it's killing you
cause everybody's on drugs

save yourself is what i'm telling you
cause nobody else really has a clue
into your veins, vein, like heroin
accept the pain, pain just to feel again, feel again

Cause everybody's on drugs
it's hard to believe, the american dream is a killing machine
we're all falling in love with a new disease
if it's killing you, then it's murdering me
it's all getting so unbelievable
we're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
and you don't see that it's killing you

everybody is dead from the neck up
trying to keep their heads up, searching for a way out
this is a dying nation, so complacent
spirits need awakened, what are we waiting for
die
just die, motherfucker, die, motherfucker die

cause everybody's on drugs
the american dream is a killing machine
everybody's on drugs
if it's killing you
it's so fucking unbelievable
we're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
and you don't see that it's killing you
cause everybody's on drugs
