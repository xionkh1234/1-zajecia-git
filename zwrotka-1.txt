kill yourself is what they said to me
Im already dead, just differently
they say god is real, i disagree
cause if that were true, then we'd all be free, all be free, yeah, yeah
running from something that's killing me, dealing with such an uncomfortable feeling
beginning to feel the hostility from my ability of slowly becoming the villain
i just wanna thank all my fans especially, without you is the death of me
i dont consider myself a celebrity, but ill be doing this shit till im 70
this is my destiny, this is the best of me, its an incredible feeling to grow
letting it go, im letting you know, we're killing ourselves on the low
