Cause everybody's on drugs
it's hard to believe, the american dream is a killing machine
we're all falling in love with a new disease
if it's killing you, then it's murdering me
it's all getting so unbelievable
we're having so much fun, staring down a loaded gun
and you don't see that it's killing you
cause everybody's on drugs
